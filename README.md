# Prediction Model for Adverse Drug Reactions Using Deep Learning Methods

Problem Statement

Drugs often have a list of side effects, and sometimes they include the prevalence of those side effects occurring in the general population. However, each patient is different, and patients are typically not given adjusted probabilities of different side effects based on their personal profile. This project will develop a model that predicts the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction for a specific patient based on other information about them. By providing patient-specific predictions, this tool can help clinicians make more informed prescribing decisions, reduce avoidable adverse reactions and improve personalized healthcare outcomes.

Objectives

Clean, preprocess, and analyze the FAERS dataset from the FDA and MIMIC-IV dataset.
Explore and implement machine learning and deep learning methods using a large dataset.
Provide useful insights about drug side effects, in the form of a personalized predictor model.
